# Django Real-Time Chatroom
Repository for developing a real-time chatroom using Django Channels web socket and Redis. This side-project serves as a prototype/proof-of-concept for developing a real-time chatroom for mental health experts to communicate with Arduino smart watch users as part of my Final Year Project (FYP) titled 'Fitweet: Arduino-based Smart Watch for Early Anticipatory Anxiety Notification System'.
